As I have received many enquiries on how to use Pegasus emulation in MESS, I thought I’d write a simple guide.________________________________________________Aamber Pegasus MESS emulation guide:Once you have installed MESS successfully, put all the Pegasus monitor ROMs in either a 'pegasus' folder (for 4k emulation) or ‘pegasusm’ folder (for 24k emulation). These folders need to exist inside the 'roms' folder. While running the MESS application look under 'Properties' here you will find a 'Miscellaneous' tab. Under this tab there is a pull down menu called 'BIOS'. You can select any Pegasus monitor versions from here (some renaming of the actual files may be needed to match what MESS is expecting). All the Pegasus monitor versions can exist in the 'pegasus' folder at the same time.Other program ROM images can be loaded into specific 'cartslots' under the 'Device' menu:Xbasic A, B and C, go in Cartslot 1, 2, and 3 respectively.Forth A, B in cartslot 1 and 2Pascal A, B in cartslot 1 and 2(tiny)Basic works in cartslot 1, 2 or 3WORD works in cartslot 1, 2 or 3MAD only works in cartslot 1Galaxy Wars only works in cartslot 1Invaders only works in cartslot 1Tank_T2R works in cartslot 1, 2 and 3 (first press ‘L’ to load Tank into RAM, then press ‘T’ to launch the game)The MESS emulator also has a virtual cassette* implemented that can load or save wav files:Hangman2: works in 24k emulator only and loads under Xbasic (type 'TLOAD' to load)Golf: 24k emulator only and loads under Xbasic (type 'TLOAD' to load)Hilo: 4k and  24k emulation under Xbasic (type 'TLOAD' to load)Hurkle: 4k and  24k emulation under Xbasic (type 'TLOAD' to load)Nicoma: 4k and  24k emulation under Xbasic (type 'TLOAD' to load)Lunar: 4k and  24k emulation under Xbasic (type 'TLOAD' to load)Startrek: (tiny)basic in 4k (do not use 24k version) (type 'LOAD' to load)Snake: (tiny)basic in 4k (do not use 24k version) (type 'LOAD' to load)CharSave: (tiny)basic in 4k (do not use 24k version) (type 'LOAD' to load)CharGen: (tiny)basic in 4k (do not use 24k version) (type 'LOAD' to load)Pegapong: (tiny)basic in 4k (do not use 24k version) (type 'LOAD' to load) Keys Q, A, O, PSurround: 4k emulation under Forth (type 'LOAD' to load and 'GO' to start) Keys 4, 3, 8, 9*Once a wav file is loaded, don't forget to manually start the virtual cassette playing under 'Devices' menu.
