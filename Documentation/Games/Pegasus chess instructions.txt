Start by going $B200.  There are several letters that can be typed to drive different functions. These are:
 
B  prints the board
C  clears the board to starting positions
E  exchanges positions, switches between Computer and Player
F  Fixes the displayed move in memory, before you press Go
G  Tells the computer to make it’s move
O  Selects the opening selection:
                1=French defence
                2=Ruy Lopez
                3=Queen’s Indian
                4=Four Knights
                5=Giuoco Piano
                (I’m no big chess player so I can’t help you here. These were taken from other games after some research)
S  Speed selection. 1=110 secs. 2=10 secs, 3=3 secs. (This still needs some refinement! The timer display has some repair needed.)
T  Toggles Timer
