A quick story:

When I was 14 in 1984, my best friend's Dad was involved with a New Zealand based computer company called Technosys who made the AAMBER PEGASUS computer.
I recall having so much fun on these magic boxes as a kid. When the company folded a short time later, the Dad gave me a complete system. Unfortunately the machine was thrown out by my parents when I was at university.
Circa 2010 I came acros another system and aquired it. I was surprised by the total lack of information online about this precious piece of New Zealand history, and I set about changing that.
Over many years I contacted people, sent hundreds of emails, and over time I was able to contact varios people and aquire a wealth of information including manuals, software and ROM dumps from multiple sources. 
I even wrote and ported a few classic BASIC games to it myself. I even had a webpage (neoncluster.com) served as my repository and had interviews with multiple employees, hardware and software guys.

This Github is the repository off all I was able to find. 
I am very proud to see that 99% of all AAMBER PEGASUS information now available on the net has come through me. I want to reach out and thank all those people he helped with all this work. Cheers!

The Scematics you see on this page where drawn by my self with A Dave from osiweb.org with the intent to build a recreation. As the schematics are now thay are not complete enough to build a system and are inface a copy of the scematics found in the Technosys manuals which are known to have errors.

Fortunately Neil has picked up the torch and a recreated AAMBER PEGASUS has been designed, built and tested and works very we'll. He's also just on the other side of town from me so that was a complete surprise.
