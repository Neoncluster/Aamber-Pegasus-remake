A quick story:

When I was 14 in 1984, my best friend's dad was involved with a New Zealand-based computer company called Technosys, which made the AAMBER PEGASUS computer. I remember having so much fun on those magic boxes as a kid. When the company folded shortly afterward, my friend's dad gave me a complete system. Unfortunately, the machine was thrown out by my parents while I was at university.

Around 2010, I came across another system and acquired it. I was surprised by the total lack of information online about this precious piece of New Zealand history, so I set out to change that. Over many years, I contacted people, sent hundreds of emails, and gradually managed to gather a wealth of information, including manuals, software, and ROM dumps from various sources. I even wrote and ported a few classic BASIC games to it myself. I created a webpage (neoncluster.com) that served as my repository and included interviews with multiple employees, as well as hardware and software experts.

This GitHub repository contains everything I was able to find. I'm proud to say that 99% of all AAMBER PEGASUS information now available on the internet has come through my efforts. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who helped with this work. Cheers!

The schematics you see on this page were drawn by me, with assistance from Dave at osiweb.org, with the intent of building a recreation. As they currently stand, the schematics are not complete enough to build a system and are essentially a copy of the ones found in the Technosys manuals, which are known to have errors.

Fortunately, Neil has picked up the torch, and a recreated AAMBER PEGASUS has been designed, built, and tested. It works very well. To my surprise, he lives just on the other side of town from me!
