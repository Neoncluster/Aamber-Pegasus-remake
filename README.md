A quick story:

In 1984, my best friend's dad was involved with a New Zealand-based computer company called Technosys, which made the AAMBER PEGASUS computer. I remember having so much fun on these magic boxes as a kid. When the company folded shortly afterward, my friend's dad gave me a complete system. Unfortunately, the machine was thrown out by my parents while I was at university.

Fast forward to 2010, and I happened across another system, and acquired it. I was surprised by the total lack of information online about this precious piece of New Zealand history, so I set out to change that. 

Over many years, I contacted dozens of people, sent hundreds of emails, and gradually managed to gather a wealth of information about Technosys and AAMBER PEGASUS, including manuals, software, ROM dumps and stories from various sources. I even wrote and ported a few classic BASIC games to it myself. At one point I had a vintage computer focused webpage (neoncluster.com) that served as my AAMBER PEGASUS repository, and included interviews with multiple Technosys employees too. I was even briefly involved with the MESS emulation of the AAMBER PEGASUS, although I didn't do much beyond provide information and do some beta testing.
over the years I have also collected 3 seperate system, but recently I passed one system onto another enthusiast to enjoy.

This GitHub repository contains everything I was able to find over a 6 year span. I'm proud to say that 99% of all AAMBER PEGASUS information now available on the internet has come through me at somepoint. The legacy lives on! I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who helped with this work. Cheers!

The schematics you see on this page were drawn by me, with a lot of assistance from Dave at osiweb.org. The intent was to design and build an AAMBER PEGASUS recreation. That never happened. As the scematics currently stand, they are not complete enough to build a system and are essentially a copy of the ones found in the Technosys manuals. The schematics in the manuals are known to have some quirks and possible errors.

My recreation process has stalled, but fortunately, Neil has picked up the torch. A replica AAMBER PEGASUS has been designed, built, and tested by multiple people (including myself). To my surprise, Neil just lives on the other side of town!
